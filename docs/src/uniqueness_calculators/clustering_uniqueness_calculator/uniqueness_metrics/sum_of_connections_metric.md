## ClassDef SumOfConnectionsMetric
**SumOfConnectionsMetric**: The function of SumOfConnectionsMetric is to apply a specific logic for calculating uniqueness scores based on the sum of connections metric.

**attributes**:
- connections_cap: Represents the maximum value allowed for connections in the uniqueness score calculation.

**Code Description**:
The SumOfConnectionsMetric class is a subclass of ClusteringUniquenessMetric and provides a method to calculate uniqueness scores by summing up the connections within a specified cap. The class initializes with a connections_cap parameter, which sets the maximum value for connections in the uniqueness score calculation.

In the apply method, the uniqueness_score is processed by summing up the values within the defined cap using np.sum and np.clip functions. The method then returns the indices of the uniqueness_score array sorted in ascending order.

This class is designed to be used within the context of clustering uniqueness calculations, leveraging the logic specific to sum of connections metric. By utilizing this class, developers can efficiently calculate uniqueness scores based on the sum of connections metric for clustering scenarios.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the connections_cap parameter to adjust the behavior of the uniqueness score calculation based on project requirements. Additionally, the apply method can be further extended or overridden to accommodate specific use cases related to clustering uniqueness metrics.

**Output Example**:
[2, 0, 1, 3]
### FunctionDef __init__(self, connections_cap)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the SumOfConnectionsMetric object with a specified connections_cap value.

**parameters**:
- connections_cap: An optional parameter that sets the maximum number of connections for the SumOfConnectionsMetric object. Defaults to sys.maxsize if not provided.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function of the SumOfConnectionsMetric class initializes the object with the specified connections_cap value. This value determines the maximum number of connections that the object can hold. If the connections_cap parameter is not provided, the default value is set to sys.maxsize, allowing for a very large number of connections.

**Note**:
It is important to set connections_cap to an appropriate value based on the requirements of your application to ensure efficient memory usage and performance.

### FunctionDef apply(self, uniqueness_score)
**apply**: The function of apply is to calculate the sum of uniqueness scores and return the indices that would sort the uniqueness scores in ascending order.

**parameters**:
- uniqueness_score: A numpy array containing uniqueness scores to be processed.

**Code Description**:
The apply function takes in a numpy array of uniqueness scores. It calculates the sum of the uniqueness scores by clipping the values between 0 and a specified connections_cap, then summing along the columns. Finally, it returns the indices that would sort the uniqueness scores in ascending order.

**Note**:
- Make sure that the uniqueness_score parameter is a numpy array.
- Ensure that the connections_cap attribute is set appropriately before calling the apply function.

**Output Example**:
[2, 0, 1, 3]
