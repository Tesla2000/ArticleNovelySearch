## ClassDef LongestSoleInNodeMetric
**LongestSoleInNodeMetric**: The function of LongestSoleInNodeMetric is to calculate uniqueness scores based on the longest sole in a node metric.

**attributes**:
- neighbours: An integer representing the number of neighbors to consider in the uniqueness calculation.

**Code Description**:
The LongestSoleInNodeMetric class is a subclass of ClusteringUniquenessMetric and is designed to calculate uniqueness scores using the longest sole in a node metric. Upon initialization, the class accepts a parameter 'neighbours' which determines the number of neighbors to consider in the uniqueness score calculation.

In the apply method, the uniqueness scores are computed by summing the occurrences where the uniqueness score is less than or equal to the specified number of neighbors. The resulting uniqueness scores are then sorted in ascending order using np.argsort and returned as an array.

This class leverages the functionality provided by the ClusteringUniquenessMetric superclass and implements the specific logic required for calculating uniqueness scores based on the longest sole in a node metric. By utilizing this class, developers can analyze and identify niche subjects within a dataset based on the specified clustering uniqueness metric.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the uniqueness score calculation by adjusting the 'neighbours' parameter to suit the specific requirements of their clustering analysis. Additionally, this class is part of a broader framework for calculating clustering uniqueness metrics within the project.

**Output Example**:
[2, 0, 1, 3]
### FunctionDef __init__(self, neighbours)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the LongestSoleInNodeMetric object with a specified number of neighbors.

**parameters**:
- neighbours: An integer representing the number of neighbors to consider. Default value is 1.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function in the LongestSoleInNodeMetric class takes an optional parameter 'neighbours' which defaults to 1. It assigns the value of 'neighbours' to the object's 'neighbours' attribute, allowing the user to specify the number of neighbors to be considered when calculating the longest sole in a node metric.

**Note**:
- The 'neighbours' parameter allows customization of the calculation based on the specific requirements of the user.
- If no value is provided for 'neighbours', the default value of 1 will be used.

### FunctionDef apply(self, uniqueness_score)
**apply**: The function of apply is to calculate the uniqueness score based on the input array and return the indices that would sort the uniqueness scores in ascending order.

**parameters**:
- uniqueness_score: An input numpy array containing uniqueness scores.
  
**Code Description**:
The apply function takes the uniqueness_score array and calculates the sum of elements that are less than or equal to the number of neighbors specified by the 'neighbours' attribute of the object. It then returns the indices that would sort the uniqueness scores in ascending order.

**Note**:
- Make sure the uniqueness_score parameter is a numpy array.
- Ensure that the 'neighbours' attribute is properly set before calling the apply function.

**Output Example**:
[2, 0, 1, 3]
