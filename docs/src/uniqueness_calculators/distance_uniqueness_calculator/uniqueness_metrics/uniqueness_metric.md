## ClassDef DistanceUniquenessMetric
**DistanceUniquenessMetric**: The function of DistanceUniquenessMetric is to define a uniqueness metric class specifically for distance calculations.

**attributes**:
- type: DistanceUniquenessMetricName

**Code Description**:
The DistanceUniquenessMetric class is a subclass of UniquenessMetric and an abstract base class. It is designed to handle uniqueness metrics related to distance calculations. The class includes an attribute 'type' that references the DistanceUniquenessMetricName enumeration class. This class structure enforces the implementation of specific uniqueness metrics for distance-based calculations. 

In the project hierarchy, the DistanceUniquenessMetric class is utilized within the DistanceUniquenessCalculator to calculate uniqueness scores based on distance metrics. By inheriting from UniquenessMetric, it ensures a consistent structure for defining and applying distance uniqueness metrics. Developers can create custom distance uniqueness metrics by subclassing DistanceUniquenessMetric and implementing the necessary methods.

**Note**:
Developers should implement the apply method in subclasses of DistanceUniquenessMetric to calculate uniqueness scores based on distance metrics. The 'type' attribute should be set to a valid DistanceUniquenessMetricName enumeration member to specify the type of distance uniqueness metric being used.
