## ClassDef Embedder
**Embedder**: The function of Embedder is to provide a base class for embedding text data.

**attributes**:
- model_config: A ConfigDict object that allows arbitrary types and is used for model configuration.

**Code Description**:
The Embedder class serves as a base class for embedding text data. It inherits from BaseModel and contains a model_config attribute of type ConfigDict that allows arbitrary types for model configuration. The class defines a method named get_embeddings, which takes in a sequence of strings representing text and a Config object as parameters. The method raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that it needs to be implemented by subclasses.

In the project, the TFEmbedder and TFIDFEmbedder classes both inherit from Embedder and provide implementations for the get_embeddings method. TFEmbedder uses a CountVectorizer for embedding text data, while TFIDFEmbedder utilizes a TfidfVectorizer. These subclasses override the get_embeddings method to calculate embeddings for the input text data based on their respective vectorizers.

The EmbeddingHolder class in the project also interacts with Embedder through the get_embeddings method. It allows for retrieving embeddings from a database, optionally using a specified Embedder object for embedding text data.

**Note**:
Developers can create custom embedding classes by subclassing Embedder and implementing the get_embeddings method to suit their specific embedding requirements.
### FunctionDef get_embeddings(self, text, config)
**get_embeddings**: The function of get_embeddings is to retrieve embeddings for a sequence of text using a specified configuration.

**parameters**:
- text: A sequence of strings for which embeddings need to be generated.
- config: An object of type "Config" that contains the configuration settings for generating embeddings.

**Code Description**:
The get_embeddings function is designed to return embeddings for a given sequence of text based on the provided configuration. However, the current implementation raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that the function needs to be implemented in a subclass or a derived class to provide the actual functionality for generating embeddings.

**Note**:
Developers using this function should create a subclass of the Embedder class and implement the get_embeddings function to provide the desired functionality for generating embeddings based on the input text and configuration.
