## ClassDef TFIDFEmbedder
**TFIDFEmbedder**: The function of TFIDFEmbedder is to calculate TF-IDF embeddings for a given sequence of text data.

**attributes**:
- vectorizer: A TfidfVectorizer object used for transforming text data into TF-IDF embeddings.

**Code Description**:
The TFIDFEmbedder class is a subclass of Embedder and implements the get_embeddings method. This method takes a sequence of strings representing text data and a Config object as input parameters. It calculates a hash value for the input texts, generates a path based on the hash value and the provided configuration, and checks if embeddings are cached at that path. If cached embeddings exist, it loads and returns them; otherwise, it calculates TF-IDF embeddings using the TfidfVectorizer object, saves the embeddings to the specified path, and returns the embeddings.

The TFIDFEmbedder class utilizes the TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn to transform the input text data into TF-IDF embeddings. By caching the embeddings, it optimizes performance by avoiding redundant calculations for the same input texts.

The class leverages the Embedder base class and extends its functionality by providing a specific implementation for TF-IDF embeddings. This allows developers to use TF-IDF embeddings for text data embedding tasks within their projects.

**Note**:
Developers can use the TFIDFEmbedder class to efficiently calculate TF-IDF embeddings for text data and leverage the caching mechanism to improve performance when dealing with repetitive text inputs.

**Output Example**:
An example of the return value from the get_embeddings method could be a NumPy array containing the TF-IDF embeddings for the input text data.
### FunctionDef get_embeddings(self, texts, config)
**get_embeddings**: The function of get_embeddings is to calculate and return embeddings for a given list of texts based on the TF-IDF vectorization method.

**parameters**:
- texts: A sequence of strings representing the texts for which embeddings need to be calculated.
- config: An object of type "Config" containing configuration settings.

**Code Description**:
The function first generates a hash value for the input texts using SHA-1 encryption. It then creates a file path based on the hash value and the specified file extension ".npy" within the embeddings_caches directory specified in the config object. If the file already exists, the function loads and returns the embeddings stored in the file. If the file does not exist, the function calculates the TF-IDF embeddings for the input texts using the vectorizer attribute of the TFIDFEmbedder object, saves the embeddings to the file path, and returns the calculated embeddings.

**Note**:
- The function relies on the vectorizer attribute of the TFIDFEmbedder object to perform the TF-IDF vectorization.
- Ensure that the config object contains a valid embeddings_caches attribute pointing to the directory where embeddings should be cached.

**Output Example**:
array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
       [0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
       [0.3, 0.4, 0.5]])
