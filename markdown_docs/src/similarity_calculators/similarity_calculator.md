## ClassDef SimilarityCalculator
**SimilarityCalculator**: The function of SimilarityCalculator is to define an abstract base class for calculating similarity between embeddings.

**attributes**:
- embeddings: An np.ndarray representing the embeddings for which the similarity will be calculated.
- config: A "Config" object containing configuration settings for the calculation.

**Code Description**: 
The SimilarityCalculator class is an abstract base class that provides a blueprint for calculating similarity between embeddings. It contains an abstract method called `calculate_similarity` that must be implemented by subclasses. The `calculate_similarity` method takes in embeddings as an np.ndarray and a configuration object of type "Config" as parameters. It then returns an np.ndarray representing the calculated similarity.

In the project, the CosineSimilarityCalculator class, located in the cosine_similarity_calculator.py file, inherits from the SimilarityCalculator class. The CosineSimilarityCalculator implements the `calculate_similarity` method using cosine similarity calculation logic. It ensures that the embeddings are not writable, computes the hash value of the embeddings, checks if a cached result exists, and if not, calculates the pairwise cosine similarity, saves the result to a file, and returns the pairwise similarity.

The UniquenessCalculator class, located in the uniqueness_calculators/uniqueness_calculator.py file, utilizes the SimilarityCalculator class by accepting an optional SimilarityCalculator object as a parameter in its constructor. If no similarity calculator is provided, it defaults to using the CosineSimilarityCalculator for similarity calculations.

**Note**: When implementing a new similarity calculator, ensure to subclass the SimilarityCalculator class and provide an implementation for the `calculate_similarity` method to define the specific similarity calculation logic.
### FunctionDef calculate_similarity(self, embeddings, config)
**calculate_similarity**: The function of calculate_similarity is to calculate the similarity between embeddings using a specified configuration.

**parameters**:
- embeddings: An np.ndarray containing the embeddings for which the similarity needs to be calculated.
- config: A "Config" object specifying the configuration parameters for the similarity calculation.

**Code Description**: 
The `calculate_similarity` function takes in embeddings and a configuration object as input parameters. It computes the similarity between the embeddings based on the provided configuration. If the function is called without being implemented in a subclass, it raises a NotImplementedError.

This function is utilized in the following contexts within the project:
1. In the `_cluster` method of the `ClusteringUniquenessCalculator` class in `clustering_uniqueness_calculator/calculator.py`, the `calculate_similarity` function is invoked to calculate pairwise similarities for clustering uniqueness calculation.
2. In the `_get_uniqueness_score` method of the `DistanceUniquenessCalculator` class in `distance_uniqueness_calculator/calculator.py`, the `calculate_similarity` function is used to obtain pairwise similarities for distance uniqueness score calculation.

**Note**: 
Developers implementing subclasses of `SimilarityCalculator` should override the `calculate_similarity` method to provide custom similarity calculation logic.
