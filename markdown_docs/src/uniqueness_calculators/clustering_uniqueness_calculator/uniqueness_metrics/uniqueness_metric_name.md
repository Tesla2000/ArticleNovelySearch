## ClassDef ClusteringUniquenessMetricName
**ClusteringUniquenessMetricName**: The function of ClusteringUniquenessMetricName is to define two enumeration constants representing different clustering uniqueness metric names: SUM_OF_CONNECTIONS and SOLE_IN_NODE.

**attributes**:
- SUM_OF_CONNECTIONS: Represents the metric name for sum of connections.
- SOLE_IN_NODE: Represents the metric name for longest sole in node.

**Code Description**:
The `ClusteringUniquenessMetricName` class is an enumeration subclass that defines two constants: `SUM_OF_CONNECTIONS` and `SOLE_IN_NODE`. These constants are used to represent different clustering uniqueness metric names within the context of the project. The `SUM_OF_CONNECTIONS` constant corresponds to the metric name for sum of connections, while the `SOLE_IN_NODE` constant corresponds to the metric name for longest sole in node.

In the project, the `ClusteringUniquenessMetricName` class is utilized by various components such as the `ClusteringUniquenessCalculator` class in the `calculator.py` file. This class uses the `ClusteringUniquenessMetricName` to determine the scope of uniqueness metric names associated with clustering uniqueness calculations.

**Note**:
Developers can leverage the `ClusteringUniquenessMetricName` enumeration constants to specify different clustering uniqueness metric names in a standardized and consistent manner throughout the project.
