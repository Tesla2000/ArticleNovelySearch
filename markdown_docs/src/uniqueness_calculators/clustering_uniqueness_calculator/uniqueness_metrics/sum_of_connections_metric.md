Doc is waiting to be generated...
### FunctionDef __init__(self, connections_cap)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the SumOfConnectionsMetric object with a specified connections_cap value.

**parameters**:
- connections_cap: An optional parameter that sets the maximum number of connections for the SumOfConnectionsMetric object. Defaults to sys.maxsize if not provided.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function of the SumOfConnectionsMetric class initializes the object with the specified connections_cap value. This value determines the maximum number of connections that the object can hold. If the connections_cap parameter is not provided, the default value is set to sys.maxsize, allowing for a very large number of connections.

**Note**:
It is important to set connections_cap to an appropriate value based on the requirements of your application to ensure efficient memory usage and performance.

### FunctionDef apply(self, uniqueness_score)
**apply**: The function of apply is to calculate the sum of uniqueness scores and return the indices that would sort the uniqueness scores in ascending order.

**parameters**:
- uniqueness_score: A numpy array containing uniqueness scores to be processed.

**Code Description**:
The apply function takes in a numpy array of uniqueness scores. It calculates the sum of the uniqueness scores by clipping the values between 0 and a specified connections_cap, then summing along the columns. Finally, it returns the indices that would sort the uniqueness scores in ascending order.

**Note**:
- Make sure that the uniqueness_score parameter is a numpy array.
- Ensure that the connections_cap attribute is set appropriately before calling the apply function.

**Output Example**:
[2, 0, 1, 3]
